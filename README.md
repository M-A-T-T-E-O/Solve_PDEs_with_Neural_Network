# Solve_PDEs_with_Neural_Network
# The goal of this work is to solve a specific PDE by a properly trained Neural Network. It is often very difficult to solve analitically the Boundery condition Poisson problem. 
# I used a different approach for solving it with a Neural Network obtaining great results
